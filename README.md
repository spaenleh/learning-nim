# Learning Nim

In this repo I collect my path learning [the Nim language](https://nim-lang.org)

## Hello World

I first write a very simple hello world program. It can be found in [hello_world.nim](./hello_world.nim)

In this example I learned about:
- printing to the console with `echo`
- reading from the standard input with `readLine`
- adding type annotations (not needed in the example)
